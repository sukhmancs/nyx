# About

I work with Nix quite often, and share some of the stuff I learn while I do so.
This website contains various notes on things that interested me, or things I
thought was worth sharing. If you would like to contribute, or have any feedback
you think would be useful, please feel free to reach out to me via email,
available at my GitHub profile or [on my website](https://notashelf.dev).

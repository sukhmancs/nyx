## High Level Overview

A high level overview of this monorepo, containing configurations for **all** of
my machines that are running or have ran NixOS at some point in time. As I
physically cannot stop tinkering with my configuration, nothing in this
repository (including the overview sections) should be considered final. As
such, it is **not recommended to be used as a template** but you are welcome to
browse the codebase to your liking, you may find bits that are interesting
or/and useful to you.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore-start -->

> [!CAUTION]
> Almost all of the configurations contained within this repository,
> in some shape or form, contain age encrypted secrets - which, to you dear
> reader, means that they **cannot** be built and replicated successfully, at
> least in theory. I invite you to go through the modules and countless lines of
> Nix I have written, but I would strongly advise against attempting to boot any
> of those configurations unless you are not me.

_Before you proceed, I would like to point you towards the [credits](#credits)
section below where I pay tribute to the individuals who have contributed to
this project, whether through code reference, suggestions, bug reports, or
simply moral support._

### Notable Features

[module options]: ./modules/options/style
[profiles]: ./modules/profiles
[wallpkgs]: https://github.com/notashelf/wallpkgs
[flake-parts]: https://flake.parts
[impermanence]: https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence

- **All-in-one** - Servers, desktops, laptops, virtual machines and anything you
  can think of. Managed in one place.
  - **Sane Defaults** - The modules attempt to bring the most sane defaults,
    while providing per-host toggles for conflicting choices.
  - **Flexible Modules** - Both Home-manager and NixOS modules allow users to
    retrieve NixOS or home-manager configurations from anywhere.
  - **Extensive Configuration** - Most desktop programs are configured out of
    the box and shared across hosts, with override options for per-host
    controls.
  - **Custom extended library** - An extended library for functions that help
    organize my system.
- **Shared Configurations** - Reduces re-used boilerplate code by sharing
  modules and profiles across hosts.
- **Fully Modular** - Utilizes NixOS' module system to avoid hard-coding any of
  the options.
  - **Profiles & Roles** - Provide serialized configuration sets and pluggables
    for easily changing large portions of configurations with less options and
    minimal imports.
  - **Detached Homes** - Home-manager configurations are able to be detached for
    non-NixOS usage.
  - **Modularized Flake Design** - With the help of [flake-parts], the flake is
    fully modular: keeping my `flake.nix` cleaner than ever.
  - **Declarative Themes** - Using my [module options], [profiles] and
    [wallpkgs]. Everything theming is handled inside the flake.
  - **Tree-wide formatting** - Format files in any language with the help of
    devshells and treefmt-nix modules for flake-parts.
- **Declarative nftables firewall** - Flexible and overengineered[^1] `nftables`
  table/chain builder abstraction for easy firewall setups.
- **Personal Installation Media** - Personalized ISO images for system
  installation and recovery.
- **Secrets Management** - Manage secrets through Agenix.
- **Opt-in Impermanence** - On-demand ephemeral root using BTRFS rollbacks and
  [impermanence].
- **Encryption Ready** - Supports and actively utilizes full disk encryption.
- **Wayland First** - Leaves Xorg in the past where it belongs. Everything is
  configured around Wayland, with Xorg only as a fallback.

## Credits & Special Thanks to

[atrocious abstractions]: ./lib/builders.nix

My special thanks go to [fufexan](https://github.com/fufexan) for convincing me
to use NixOS and sticking around to answer my most stupid and deranged
questions, as well as my [atrocious abstractions].

And to [sioodmy](https://github.com/sioodmy) which my configuration is initially
based on. The simplicity of his configuration flake allowed me to take a
foothold in the Nix world.

### Awesome People

[^1]:
    I speak of overengineering not as a flaw, but as a trait that can properly
    describe the time and effort that this repository has taken. After 700+ recorded
    hours and 4000+ commits, that is the only word that can describe this project.
